        <h2>Get to Know Catia Bastioli</h2>
        <p>Bastioli's persistent love for chemistry lead her to the University
            of Perugia where she graduated in pure chemistry. She then 
            went on to attend the Business Management School at Bocconi 
            University, before starting her career in materials science 
            and environmental sustainability at Montedison's Corporate 
            Research Centre.</p>
        <p>This is where she realised she could apply her knowledge to create
            bioplastics. Alongside this, she also aided in the founding of a 
            research centre here that became Novamont.[2a]</p>
