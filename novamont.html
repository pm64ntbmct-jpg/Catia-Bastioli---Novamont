            <h2>What have they done?</h2>
            <p>Novamont developed MATER-BI, a line of bio-based plastics that are both 
                biodegradable and compostable. These plastics are created using patented 
                technologies that process starches, vegetable oils, and their combinations.
                 MATER-BI was designed by Novamont to address specific environmental 
                 challenges and encourage more sustainable practices. [3a]

    <h2>How do they do this?</h2>
    <p>To produce their MATER-BI bioplastic, Novamont converts starch into thermoplastic. 
        They found that combining thermoplastic starch with synthetic polymers can create 
        multiple types of biodegradable materials, which form the basis of their products. 
        They are all based on starch and use differing synthetic components. [3b]
    </p>

    <p>Novamont won the 2019 Innovation in Bioplastics Award for all of this hard work. [3c]</p>

    <p>Novamont followed an approach based on 3 main points: [3b]</p>
    <ul><li>Use abundant, cost-effective natural raw materials which are available annually in surplus from crops in the USA and Europe such as starch, proteins, cellulose and vegetable oils.</li>
    <li>Leverage the expertise of an experienced, interdisciplinary Materials Science team</li>
    <li>Develop tailor-made materials for specific applications through close collaboration between R&D and the market</li></ul>
