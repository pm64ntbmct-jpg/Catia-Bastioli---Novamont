            <p>Through ongoing R&D, Novamont's material scientists developed Mater-Bi, 
                a fully biodegradable and compostable biopolymer made from corn starch 
                and other renewable raw materials. <br>As a market-leading bioplastic, 
                Mater-Bi combines the versatility of conventional plastics with 
                environmental benefits. [4a] </p>

        <h2>What this means</h2>
            <p>Catia Bastioli's pioneering work in bioplastics has had a lasting impact 
                on industry and society. Through Mater-Bi, a family of plant-based and 
                biodegradable polymers, she provided a sustainable alternative to 
                traditional plastics. Mater-Bi helps preserve the environment by reducing 
                pollution, improving soil fertility, lowering greenhouse gas emissions 
                and decreasing both pesticide and water use. By combining eco design and 
                innovative chemistry, Bastioli demonstrates how science and entrepreneurship 
                can tackle plastic pollution, soil degradation and climate change.  </p>

        <h2>No AI use</h2>
        <p>Novamont and Bastioli further demonstrate their want for environmental 
            preservation by not using AI in their work. Well - hopefully. There was nothing 
        available online to suggest that Novamont use AI in any way, but it is possible 
        that they are making use of it but not disclosing it. However their work clearly displays 
        a deep concern for our climate so it is very possible they have strict rules against AI.  </p>
